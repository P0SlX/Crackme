This version of Adventure is the complete one, the old one is missing one step. Gonna try the 3rd chap' soon

I'm going to use ltrace just as the first version of adventure
So, first 
    $   ltrace ./adventure hello

        $   Welcome to the very easy adventure 
        $   A serie of challenge you can only solve by disassembling. 
        $   Good luck ! the 1st challenge already started !

        $   * After being sumonned from another world, you're going to the adventurer's guild
        $   * A gold ranked adventurer is guarding the door... you're heading toward him...

        $   "Friendly greetings to you. I never saw you here before !" What's the purpose of your visit ?
then,
    $   ./adventure

        $   "./adventure ? Good, good, welcome to the guild hall!"

        $   -------
        $   * you enter the guild hall
        $   * In front of you is the bar
        $   * To the left is the registration office
        $   * To the right you see the adventure desk and a panel with quest waiting to be accepted

        $   Where do you go ?

Enter a random thing and see to what it is compared to with strcmp();
aaaand here it is: To the left

    $   Where do you go ?
    $   To the left
    $   "Welcome to the registration office!"

This was very easy and without the need of decompiling the program, it's maybe cheating but I got it right tho...



For the second one, I used Ghidra and gdb

First let's execute without args

    Press enter the first time bc it does nothing
    Then if we look at Ghidra, we can see that it got a getchar() and verify if the value is equal to 0x48 which is a "H" in hex
    then if it is equal to an "e"
    then a "l", twice..
    and an "o"..... Hello
    press enter twice and we are in the step 2 !

(We can go directly to step 2 with arg between 200 and 299)
(Like for ex: ./adventure2 236)

STEP 2:

    For the second step I will be using 200 as arg 
    When it ask "By the way, what argument did you use to come here ?"
    Just press enter twice (not working if you don't provide arg when exec the program)

    It shows this:

        - So you want to register to the guild ? Math question then !
        - it's totally not because i'm lazy or anything ! Bakkaaaa~ !
        what's 
         + 3 * 5 ? 

    To know what value it requires I used gdb and break at the step2

        $ gdb ./adventure2
        $ set disassenbly-flavor intel (bc AT&T is a total mess)
        $ break *step2

    We can see that the value is calculated at 0x...ee0, so we can use "ni" to reach this value and check the register at this adress

        $ ni

    press enter until we reach ee0 and check the register

        $ info registers
    
    BINGO ! RAX is at 65, soooooo go test it !

    enter 65 when it ask "+ 3 * 5 ?"

    voil√† !
    This was not the hardest one but it was fun for sure !!
